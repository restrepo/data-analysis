    "__General concept__: The interface that you are using or visualizing in this moment is a [jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org). Installation instructions can be found there. Extra required software is listed in the [requirements.txt](requirements.txt).\n",
    "\n",
    "__Philosophy__: This kind interface is designed to implement the so called _literal programming_, where the code can be mixed with rich formatted text which can even include mathematical formulas, like $E=\\gamma mc^2$. This kind of mixed text-code documents are heavily used for several purposes like:\n",
    "* Reproducible research papers.\n",
    "* Self-contained textbooks.\n",
    "* Code explorations to create full program codes.\n",
    "* As a platform to share data-analysis and results with collaborators.\n",
    "* etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Design__: It is an interactive page which consist of something called executable cells. The lines that\n",
    "you are just reading  now are part of one ot the executable cell of this page, called _[Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) cell_.\n",
    "The executable cells are basically of two types. Both of them can be executed from the jupyter menu in the top of the page or with the key combination `<Shift>+<Enter>`:.\n",
    "* Markdown cell: which are rich text cells like this one. When activated works like a text editor. It is activated by double clicking in any part of the text. After that, you can return back to the reading mode by using the\n",
    "key combination `<Shift>+<Enter>` and the rich text written with the [Markdown syntax](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) will be fully displayed again.\n",
    "  * __Activity__: Please double click into this cell to enter the edit mode. Then write something (hopefully using [Markdown syntax](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) syntax) and hit `<Shift>+<Enter>` when done to return back here. \n",
    "* Input code cell, like the one below to the side of the \"`In [ ]:` \" text. There you can write code in `Python`. A new cell with the output is created after the execution. \n",
    "  * __Activity__: Please write some mathematical operation, like `2+2`, in the next cell and hit `<Shift>+<Enter>`."
